# AI Chatbot Assistant - Implementation Guide

## Overview

The Expense Management System now includes an intelligent AI chatbot powered by **Gemini 2.0 Flash**, designed to assist employees, managers, and admins with expense-related queries, policy questions, and system navigation.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Role-Based Assistance

The chatbot adapts its responses based on the user's role:

#### **For Employees**
- **Status & Transparency**: Check expense status, approval progress, rejection reasons, reimbursement timelines
- **Company Policy**: Per diem rates, expense limits, receipt requirements, claimable expenses
- **How-To Guidance**: Submit expenses, handle foreign currency, deal with lost receipts, create reports
- **Proactive Reminders**: Pending submissions, deadlines, unsubmitted receipts

Example Questions:
- "What is the status of my expense from last week?"
- "Who is approving my â‚¹8,500 expense?"
- "What's the per diem for travel to Delhi?"
- "How do I submit a foreign currency expense?"
- "Do I need a receipt for expenses under â‚¹500?"

#### **For Managers**
- **Approval Workflow**: View pending approvals, filter by amount/team member, display approval chains
- **Team Analytics**: Spending summaries, top spenders, category breakdowns, budget tracking
- **Quick Actions**: Approve/reject directly from chat (future feature)
- **Team Management**: Spending patterns and compliance monitoring

Example Questions:
- "How many expenses are pending my approval?"
- "Show pending expenses over â‚¹10,000"
- "What's my team's total spend this quarter?"
- "Who are the top 5 spenders on my team?"
- "Which category does my team spend most on?"

#### **For Admins**
- **System Configuration**: Approval rules, user assignments, department settings, workflow configurations
- **User Management**: User roles, manager assignments, access permissions
- **Policy Management**: Active policies, approval thresholds, rule sequences
- **System Analytics**: Company-wide spending insights and compliance metrics

Example Questions:
- "Who is Sameer Gupta's manager?"
- "What's the approval rule for Marketing department?"
- "Show approver sequence for expenses over â‚¹50,000"
- "Is CFO auto-approval active?"

```

## Troubleshooting

### Chatbot Not Responding

1. **Check API Key**: Ensure `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set correctly
2. **Check Console**: Look for errors in browser console
3. **Check Network**: Verify `/api/chatbot` endpoint is accessible
4. **Check Session**: Ensure user is logged in

### Slow Responses

1. **Enable Streaming**: Set `stream: true` in API request
2. **Optimize Prompts**: Reduce system prompt length
3. **Check API Quota**: Verify Gemini API usage limits

### Incorrect Responses

1. **Improve Prompts**: Add more context to system prompts
2. **Add Examples**: Include few-shot examples in prompts
3. **Validate Input**: Check user message formatting

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Prompts Concise**: Shorter prompts = faster responses
2. **Use Suggested Questions**: Guide users to ask effective questions
3. **Provide Context**: Include relevant user information in prompts
4. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Show friendly error messages
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Test with different user roles and scenarios

## Support
