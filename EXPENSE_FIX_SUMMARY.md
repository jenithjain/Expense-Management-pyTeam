# Expense Data Visibility Fix

## Problem
No expenses were showing on the frontend dashboard despite expenses being created in the database.

## Root Cause
**ObjectId Type Mismatch**: The MongoDB queries were comparing `session.user.id` (string) directly with `employeeId` (ObjectId) in the database. MongoDB requires proper type conversion for ObjectId queries to work correctly.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed API Routes with ObjectId Conversion

#### `/api/expenses/my-expenses/route.ts`
- Added `mongoose` import
- Converted `session.user.id` to ObjectId: `new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(session.user.id)`
- This ensures proper matching of employee expenses

#### `/api/dashboard/employee/route.ts`
- Added `mongoose` import
- Created `employeeObjectId` variable for reuse
- Updated all queries to use ObjectId instead of string
- Fixed response structure to match frontend expectations:
  - Changed from nested `statistics` object to flat structure
  - Added `totalAmount` calculation for approved expenses
  - Added `currency` field from company settings
  - Properly formatted `recentExpenses` array
  - Added `originalCurrency` field to recent expenses

#### `/api/expenses/create/route.ts`
- Added `mongoose` import
- Converted both `employeeId` and `companyId` to ObjectId when creating expenses
- Ensures future expenses are stored with proper ObjectId references

### 2. Fixed Dashboard Response Structure

**Before:**
```json
{
  "statistics": {
    "totalExpenses": 5,
    "pendingExpenses": 2,
    ...
  },
  "recentExpenses": [...]
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "totalExpenses": 5,
  "pendingExpenses": 2,
  "approvedExpenses": 2,
  "rejectedExpenses": 1,
  "totalAmount": 1500.00,
  "currency": "USD",
  "currentMonthSpending": 500.00,
  "spendingByCategory": [...],
  "recentExpenses": [
    {
      "_id": "...",
      "merchantName": "...",
      "amount": 100,
      "originalCurrency": "USD",
      "status": "Pending",
      "date": "2025-10-04"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Added Debug Endpoint

Created `/api/debug/expenses` to help diagnose data issues:
- Shows session user ID and type
- Lists all expenses in database
- Compares ObjectId types
- Helps verify data integrity

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `app/api/expenses/my-expenses/route.ts`
2. ✅ `app/api/dashboard/employee/route.ts`
3. ✅ `app/api/expenses/create/route.ts`
4. ✅ `app/api/debug/expenses/route.ts` (new)

## Testing Steps

1. **Clear the dev server and restart:**
   ```powershell
   cd expense-tracker
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the dashboard:**
   - Navigate to `/employee` page
   - Dashboard stats should now show correct counts
   - Recent expenses should be visible

3. **Test expense creation:**
   - Create a new expense with receipt
   - Verify it appears immediately in the expense history

4. **Debug if needed:**
   - Visit `/api/debug/expenses` to see database state
   - Check console for any MongoDB errors

## Key Changes Summary

- ✅ Fixed ObjectId type mismatches in all expense queries
- ✅ Updated dashboard API response structure
- ✅ Added proper type conversion for MongoDB queries
- ✅ Fixed recent expenses data format
- ✅ Added total amount calculation
- ✅ Added currency field from company settings

## Expected Results

After these fixes:
- ✅ Dashboard shows correct expense statistics (Total, Pending, Approved, Rejected)
- ✅ Total amount is calculated and displayed
- ✅ Recent expenses list shows up to 5 recent items
- ✅ Expense history table shows all user's expenses with pagination
- ✅ New expenses are properly saved and immediately visible

## Notes for Future Development

1. **Consistent Type Usage**: Always convert string IDs to ObjectId when querying MongoDB
2. **API Response Structure**: Keep frontend and backend data structures in sync
3. **Type Safety**: Consider using TypeScript interfaces for API responses
4. **Testing**: Test with real data after database schema changes
