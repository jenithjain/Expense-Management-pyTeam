## 🔧 External APIs Integrated

1. **Countries API** (`https://restcountries.com/v3.1/`)
   - Fetches currency information based on country code
   - Used during company creation on signup

2. **Exchange Rate API** (`https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/`)
   - Provides real-time currency conversion rates
   - Cached for 1 hour to optimize API calls
   - Automatic conversion of expense amounts to company currency

## 🚀 Next Steps to Complete the Application

### Frontend Integration (Not Yet Implemented)

1. **Update existing pages to use new APIs:**
   - `/app/auth/login/page.tsx` - Connect to NextAuth signin
   - `/app/auth/signup/page.tsx` - Connect to `/api/auth/signup`
   - `/app/employee/page.tsx` - Use employee dashboard API
   - `/app/manager/page.tsx` - Use manager dashboard API
   - `/app/admin/page.tsx` - Use admin dashboard API

2. **Create new components:**
   - Expense submission form with OCR support
   - Approval workflow configuration UI
   - User management interface
   - Expense history tables
   - Approval pending list for managers

3. **Update existing components:**
   - `components/employee/expense-form.tsx` - Add OCR, line items
   - `components/employee/expense-history.tsx` - Connect to API
   - `components/manager/approvals-table.tsx` - Connect to API
   - `components/admin/user-management.tsx` - Full CRUD operations
   - `components/admin/approval-rules.tsx` - Rule configuration

### Environment Setup

1. **Create `.env.local` file:**
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/expense-tracker
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-generated-secret
```

2. **Generate NextAuth secret:**
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### Testing

1. **Test authentication flow:**
   - Signup → Creates company and admin user
   - Login → Receives JWT with role and companyId

2. **Test expense workflow:**
   - Employee creates expense
   - Upload receipt and scan with OCR
   - Manager receives approval request
   - Manager approves/rejects

3. **Test approval rules:**
   - Admin creates sequential rule
   - Admin creates percentage rule
   - Verify correct workflow execution

## 📊 Database Collections

The following MongoDB collections will be created:

1. **companies** - Company information
2. **users** - User accounts with roles
3. **expenses** - Expense submissions
4. **approvalrules** - Approval workflow rules
5. **approvalrequests** - Individual approval requests

## 🔐 Security Features

- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt (10 salt rounds)
- ✅ JWT-based session management
- ✅ Role-based access control on all endpoints
- ✅ Company-scoped data isolation
- ✅ File upload validation (type and size limits)
- ✅ Input sanitization for filenames

## 📝 API Endpoints Summary

- **User Management**: 4 endpoints
- **Expense Management**: 3 endpoints
- **Approval Rules**: 3 endpoints
- **Approval Actions**: 2 endpoints

2. **Intelligent OCR** that extracts merchant, amount, date, items
3. **Flexible approval workflows** supporting 4 different strategies
4. **Hierarchical user management** with manager-employee relationships
5. **Real-time exchange rates** with smart caching
6. **Role-specific dashboards** with analytics
7. **Complete audit trail** via approval requests

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

- Connection pooling for MongoDB
- Exchange rate caching (1 hour)
- Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Pagination for large result sets
- Selective field population

## 🎨 Ready for Frontend Integration

All backend APIs are complete and ready to be consumed by the frontend. The existing UI components in your project can now be connected to these APIs to create a fully functional expense management system.

**Status: Backend Implementation 100% Complete ✅**
